# Social-Network
This is my first bigger project in <b>Java</b>. I have spent on this about three months. On it I learned to programming.

 I used here <b>JavaFX, FXML, CSS, SQL</b>.

### Libraries

*  [JFoenix]
*  [ControlsFX]
*  [Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server]

### Tools

*  [IntelliJ]

### Building tools

*  [Maven]



What's next?
----

  - The project should improve exception handling.
  - Remained several functions not programmed.
  - Improve the appearance, but it looks pretty OK.
